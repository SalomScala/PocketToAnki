PocketToAnki
======

Exports Information over saved articles from http://getpocket.com and converts them to the input format of http://ankisrs.net.

The idea behind the connection between the two services is, that I occasionally want to reread articles I have read.
To automate these process I use the flash cards of Anki to link to articles of Pocket. 

To use PocketToAnki you have to create a *consumer_key* and an *access_token* for your pocket account. (https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication)

Further I have tested http://argonaut.io/ to work with JSON.
